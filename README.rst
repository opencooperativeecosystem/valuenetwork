NRP/OCP Dec/2018
============================

Status
---------

This version was forked for use by ORGIA in Italy as a backend for the shroom UI.  We see this as a short-term solution for groups starting out now, pending a more distributed architecture becoming stable. We hope this will be within a few months.

This was forked from LearnDeep's OCP, which was forked from Freedom Coop's OCP, which was forked from Mikorizal's NRP.  This version was cleaned up of most of the Freedom Coop / FairCoop specific code.
